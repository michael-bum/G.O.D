# Build the four NL2Bash filesystem snapshots used by validator/evaluation/eval_intercode.py.
#
# Upstream intercode (princeton-nlp/intercode) ships one setup_nl2b_fs_{1,2,3,4}.sh per
# variant; each is intended to be baked into its own image. Here we run all four
# inside the same builder stage and capture their post-state as tarballs under
# /intercode_fs/, so the runtime image can restore any of them on demand without
# needing docker.
#
# Inputs (set by the dockerfile):
#   INTERCODE_REPO   path to a checkout of princeton-nlp/intercode
# Outputs:
#   /intercode_fs/fs1.tar, fs2.tar, fs3.tar   (fs4 has no managed filesystem)
